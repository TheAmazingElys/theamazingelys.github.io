		<h2>
			Publications
		</h2>
		<p>
			My publications are listed on <a href="https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=nLfJmIIAAAAJ&hl=fr">Google Scholar</a>
			and <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Allesiardo_Robin">Researchgate</a>. Most of the associated pdf are also <a href="https://github.com/rallesiardo/rallesiardo.github.io/tree/master/papers">here</a>. While most of them were published in international conferences and journals, I also try to be active at a nationnal level. Thus some of them are in written in french and available <a href="https://github.com/rallesiardo/rallesiardo.github.io/tree/master/papers/FR"/>here</a>; but they still have their english counterparts in the main folder.<br>
